Reboot mode driver for Amlogic S905/GX*/AXG SoCs

In the Amlogic SoCs the standard SYSTEM_RESET PSCI call is extended to support
an additional parameter (arg0) used to save the reboot reason / mode into the
special register AO_SEC_SD_CFG15. This register won't be reset until the
RESET_N pin on the chip is set to low. The bootloader can read it and take
different actions according to the argument stored.

The association between the reboot code and the reboot reason seems to be
hardcoded and in some cases the code is set without kernel intervention (i.e.
when the reboot is caused by the watchdog).

From the Amlogic SDK:

3:     Upgrade system            update
4:     Fastboot                  fastboot
5:     Suspend                   suspend_off
6:     Hibernate                 hibernate
7:     Fastboot Bootloader       bootloader
8:     Shutdown reboot           shutdown_reboot
9:     RPMBP reboot              rpmbp
10:    reserved
11:    Crash dump                crash_dump

	        compatible = "amlogic,meson-reboot-mode";
	};
